# F1 2008 CHAMPIONSHIP

The 2008 Formula 1 championship was one of the closest title fights in the history of the sport. In the last lap Lewis Hamilton overtook Timo Glock and became world chamption by one point over Felipe Massa. The points rewarded to the pilots were different of today's formula 1 championship. If the points system them was the same as today's, Lewis Hamilton still would won the championship? If the CrashGate, in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix,  didn't happen, Massa would have the amount of points necessary to win the world champsionship? I will try to answer those questions in this project using Pandas and Python.
